Sonj
====

*Yet another JSON library. It's light weight, easy to use, and geard towards being nonintrusive.*

About
-----
Sonj is designed to be a basic tool to work with the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data-interchange format in Java.
It does both parsing and serializing of JSON data to and from a tree of maps and lists, while trying to minimize the effort to connect it to existing data structures.

Build using Ant
---------------
Sonj can be build using [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). The build script is located in `build.xml` and can be configured in `build.properties`.

An executable jar can be built by running: `ant all`
